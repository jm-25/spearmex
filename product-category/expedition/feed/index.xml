										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Sea Doo Wake Pro 230</h2>
<p>Enjoying tow sports from our JetSki has never been easier thanks to three exclusive features including the retractable LinQ ski pylon, ski mode, and wakeboard rack.</p>
<p>The first fully-integrated waterproof Audio System will keep the fun going anywhere you go, standard with 100 watts of total system power, fully-waterproof performance, Bluetooth connectivity, and external playback controls to ensure the perfect song is always on!</p>
<p><strong>KEY FEATURES</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>BRP Audio &#8211; Premium Soundsystem</li>
<li>Direct-access front storage</li>
<li>Watertight phone compartment</li>
<li>Boarding Ladder</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>ACTIVITIES AVAILABLE</strong></h3>
<p><strong>FOIL SURFING</strong></p>
<p>Foilsurfing shifts that paradigm and completely redefines what kind of wave will get your heart racing.</p>
<p>Your first foilsurfing lesson takes place in the waterway where the water is flat, so you can learn the basics of riding a foilboard. Once you&#8217;ve got the hang of foiling in flat water, we will advance you to the next step by taking you out into the ocean where we&#8217;ll begin towing into ocean swell.</p>
<p>This is where you will learn how to catch and ride the swell energy and begin to learn the mechanics of pumping the foil to stay on the swell.</p>
<p><strong>WIND FOILING</strong></p>
<p>Windfoiling is relatively easy to learn, especially if you already know how to windsurf. The first few runs will be challenging as you need to get used to controlling the foil with small body movements. Pretty quickly you will finally understand the influence of your body weight and find the right position on your board.</p>
<p>Windfoiling is also far less physically demanding than windsurfing. Since you&#8217;ll be flying above the sea, there is no friction between the water and your board. The hydrodynamic drag is minimal and you don&#8217;t get battered around by the waves.</p>
<p>This makes windfoiling suitable for everybody, regardless of age or gender.</p>
<p><strong>WAKE FOILING</strong></p>
<p>Learning to how to foil is easy when you book a lesson with one of our experienced and knowledgeable coaches. Trying to figure it out on your own, on the other hand, can be a deeply intimidating and frustrating experience. When you learn with us, we&#8217;ll get you up on the foil the faster and safer way. Getting your first rides behind a jet ski dramatically simplifies and accelerates the learning curve.</p>
<p>Instead of guessing and learning by trial and error, our coaches will teach you the mechanics of foiling through a gradual progression on equipment that makes it as easy and safe as possible. Whether you are interested in foiling with a kite, a boat, or in the waves, we can get you where you want to go.</p>
<p><strong>WAKEBOARDING</strong></p>
<p>The wake board is another popular choice on the water and you don’t have to be able snowboard or water ski to enjoy wakeboarding. It’s a sport that provides a sense of achievement and thrills even for even complete novices. Do not miss the opportunity of a Wakeboarding sesion.</p>
<p>Allow yourself to relax allows your body to make changes and shift weight far easier than if you are tensed up. Before you are towed, you will start with the cable in hand and your knees drawn up as far as possible to your chest. Your arms should be stretched out in front of you.</p>
<p>Wakeboarding is all about going with the flow; once you feel the cable being pulled, allow yourself to roll forward slightly and keep your knees locked as your speed increases. Before you know it, you will be standing upright!</p>
<p><strong>DONUT RIDING</strong></p>
<p>An inflatable tube which is designed to be like a donut is towed behind a watercraft. Immerse yourself in the experience of speed and thrill as you glide on the water. You not only get to be on the Donut while having a time of your life but you’ll also be able to soak in the amazing coastline.</p>
<p>This amazing activity shouldn’t be missed especially by those who live for the high speed and thrill. With its twist and turns, high speed, it’ll surely test your strength while having the wildest ride of your life.</p>
<p>Our donut ride is a great choice for anyone new to watersports. It is also an amazing way to introduce young kids to the world of watersports. As this activity is suitable for everyone, we take extra measures for children and new adventurers.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Join our marine biologist/guide and Four Seasons chef for a coastal walk in search of edible sea life amongst a world of sea stars and seaweed... native swimmers and scuttlers.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Reading the seasons, timing the tides, and knowing your sea life can reveal a smorgasbord of healthy food for foraging. With the help of your guide and chef, you too can learn to recognize valuable sea life, learn their uses, and get to know some key recipes.</p>
<p>Gathering and consuming wild plants and animal instills a greater respect for the environment that is their home. This experience reconnects us to the origins of our food and vividly illustrates our dependance on nature for our survival. You will not need to get into the ocean to take part in this empowering experience; however water shoes will be provided.<br />
Step away from online recipes and store bought ingredients and into the forgotten reality that the earth provides everything we need.</p>

<p>These offshore dive sites offer both virgin reefs and pelagic big life encounters worthy of Nat Geo documentary footage; Schooling Tuna flying past, reefs swarming with sea turtles, Humpback whale mothers introducing their calves to the world, reef sharks resting within the volcanic nooks, giant manta rays visiting the reefs’ cleaning stations to be service by the most intricately colored tropical fish, even the tiniest most delicate sea horse as they hold the reef into which they seem to the untrained eye to disappear.</p>
