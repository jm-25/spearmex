										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Freediving has been captivating the world for years with romantic visions of lone divers in the deep blue, unprecedented marine-life encounters, and the alluring discipline of moving meditation. Now it is your chance to immerse yourself in a magnificent underwater world that can only be experienced from within. A truly intriguing way to explore the aquatic realm, the practice of free diving is simultaneously a personal challenge and an experience of bliss; both an exercise and a meditation; a solo act that at the same time creates a feeling of unity and belonging.</p>

Come and challenge yourself to explore the beauty of the ocean in a compelling new way.</p>
